# Eyes-Controlled-Mouse-Cursor

Introduction :

This project uses an eye tracker to measure eye movements and positions, allowing users to interact with computers using their eyes. The device requires a computer or laptop with a built-in webcam, and an eye control mouse cursor. This solution is designed for physically disabled people, allowing them to use modern computers independently. Previous methods have used brain signals, facial muscles signals, and electro-oculograms to assist disabled users. The project uses image processing for background elimination, grayscale background removal, and edge detection to detect the eyes and mouth in the frame.

Problem Statement :

Currently as today, there are around 21 million people in India who are suffering from one or more than one physical disability which constitutes around 2 percent of India’s population. In today’s era computers have become a significant part of our lives. Such people cannot readily use the computer system. Our problem is to develop a system which can help such people who are physically disabled but visually intact to use the computer system, so that their physical disability won’t hinder their abilities to use a computer.
